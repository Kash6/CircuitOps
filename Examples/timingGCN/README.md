# timingGCN
This is a cross-stage timing predictor.
It uses a GNN to predict the slacks at timing endpoints.

This script is based on the paper:

Zizheng Guo, Mingjie Liu, Jiaqi Gu, Shuhan Zhang, David Z. Pan, and Yibo Lin. 2022. A timing engine inspired graph neural network model for pre-routing slack prediction. In Proceedings of the 59th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC '22). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 1207â€“1212. https://doi.org/10.1145/3489517.3530597

The source code from the paper was initially modified by Chih-Yu Lai <chihyul@mit.edu> to adapt for CircuitOps. The modified code is taken to create an example use case for CircuitOps.

## Usage
```
python3 src/main.py -d "gcd" -t "nangate45" -design_path "<path to design files>"

Arguments:
-d --> Optional argument to provide design name. Default: gcd
-t --> Optional argument to provide tech node. Default: nangate45
-design_path --> Required argument to provide the path of directory containing .v and .def files of the design.

Make sure you already have the IR tables generated for the design needed.
IR tables location: ./IRs/<technode>/<design>/
```
